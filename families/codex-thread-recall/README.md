# codex-thread-recall

Inspect the current Codex thread's raw rollout history before doing fresh broad exploration.

This family is Codex-only. It reads the exact current thread from
`CODEX_THREAD_ID`, resolves its rollout path through the local Codex
`state_5.sqlite`, and builds a cached structured index of that thread's own
JSONL history. It does not search other threads and it does not guess by cwd or
title when exact resolution fails.

The cache lives under `CODEX_HOME/cache/codex-thread-recall/`. It is
append-aware: the first recall on a thread builds the index, later calls reuse
it, and normal thread growth only indexes newly appended newline-terminated
JSONL records.

The helper is intentionally thread-generic. It uses broad signals such as:

- timestamps, roles, entry types, and commands
- ordinary file paths
- explicit backticked identifiers
- repos, PR numbers, commit ids, and event verbs like `published` or `merged`

It does not bake in repo-local folder names, marketplace names, or workspace-specific heuristics.

## Commands

```powershell
uv run --project families/codex-thread-recall agent-toolbelt-codex-thread-recall status
uv run --project families/codex-thread-recall agent-toolbelt-codex-thread-recall recall --profile general
uv run --project families/codex-thread-recall agent-toolbelt-codex-thread-recall timeline --kind shipped --group entity
uv run --project families/codex-thread-recall agent-toolbelt-codex-thread-recall grep --pattern "CODEX_THREAD_ID"
```

Optional filters and overrides:

- `--thread-id <id>` for offline debugging or tests
- `--codex-home <path>` to override the default Codex home directory
- `recall --profile general|shipping|debug`
- `timeline --kind shipped|published|merged|pushed|installed|validated|all`
- `timeline --group entity|repo|none`
- `grep --role ... --entry-type ... --payload-type ... --after ... --before ... --include-noise`

## Output shape

- `status` resolves the current thread and rollout path.
- `recall` returns a bounded brief with summary, known facts, decisions, touched
  paths, commands, blockers, open questions, and evidence pointers.
- `timeline` returns grouped or flat event history with timestamps, excerpts,
  entities, repos, PRs, commits, and elapsed timing.
- `grep` searches the indexed current-thread history and returns bounded evidence
  instead of raw transcript dumps.

Successful indexed responses also include cache metadata:

- `index.used`
- `index.built`
- `index.stale`
- `index.entry_count`
- `index.noise_filtered_count`
- `index.appended_entries`

Failure is explicit:

- `thread_unavailable` when `CODEX_THREAD_ID` is missing or not found
- `rollout_missing` when the rollout JSONL path cannot be read
